# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## 1. What Kinds of Behavior Cause Sexual Harassment?

**Inappropriate Jokes and Comments**
   - Making jokes or comments about someone’s looks or gender can make them feel uncomfortable and disrespected.

**Unwanted Touching**
   - Touching someone without their permission is a violation of personal space and can make them feel unsafe.

**Persistent Advances**
   - Continuing to ask someone out after they’ve said no shows a lack of respect for their feelings and boundaries.

**Sharing Explicit Material**
   - Sending or showing sexually explicit content without consent invades privacy and creates an uncomfortable environment.

**Disrespectful Staring and Gestures**
   - Making suggestive looks or gestures objectifies a person, making them feel uncomfortable.
     
## 2. What Would You Do in Case You Face or Witness Any Incident or Repeated Incidents of Such Behavior?

**Address the Behavior Immediately**
  - If you feel safe doing so, confront the individual in the moment. Clearly communicate that their behavior is inappropriate and unacceptable.

**Report the Incident**
  - Whether you are the victim or a witness, promptly report the behavior to a supervisor, HR, or a designated authority within your organization. Timely reporting can help ensure appropriate action is taken.
